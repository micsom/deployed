Design Features
Modern grid/card UI with soft shadows, glassmorphism, or subtle gradients

Animated timeline/progress steps (“Your Build in Progress…”)

Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling (for demo, mock it)

Success state with “diiing” sound and a confetti burst (Framer Motion)

All text and visuals explain your automation, security, badge, and user benefits

Mobile responsive, but looks best on desktop

Next.js + React (with Tailwind for styling)

Framer Motion for beautiful animations

Let’s Build the Frontend Code!
I’ll create a Next.js/React component that you can use as the main dashboard.
You’ll get:

Aesthetic UI with animated progress

“Diiing” sound on completion

Modern design, dark/light friendly

Ready for Code?
Do you want the whole Next.js app, or just the key Dashboard component?
And do you want “live” progress for demo (auto-advance each step with delays), or to wait for backend events?

Let me know if you want a specific color palette or branding touch!
Otherwise, I’ll generate a production-ready, plug-and-play Next.js page you can use right away—with all the fun!

Lets do silver-white, black, and royal purple as color scheeme - mninimalistic style . think Apple (but style-wise 300% more improved more than their iPhones ever will)

Absolutely—love the ambition and taste!
We’ll go for a next-gen, minimalistic “Apple x Zeal” aesthetic:

Color Palette: Silver-white, deep black, royal purple highlights

Style: Ultra-clean, bold but subtle, ultra-modern UI

UX: Glassmorphism, soft transitions, beautiful font pairing, oversized status icons

Preview of Visual Direction
Background: Subtle silvery gradient, hints of purple or glass blur

Cards/Steps: Jet-black with semi-transparent white overlays, soft purple accents, and gentle drop shadows

Typography: Crisp, geometric sans-serif, spaced for readability (think SF Pro, Inter, or similar)

Progress Steps: Big, spaced, clear, animated in sequence

Confetti: Minimal, only at end

Sound: Gentle “diiing” (Apple-esque, but unique—ready to use a sound or point to a royalty-free MP3/WAV)
